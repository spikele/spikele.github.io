=================
I set the development environment up at the beginning. I had to install vagrant, which runs Ubuntu without UI, for that.
I also created my own Git account using a SSH key for that.
With the environment set up, I added a red/green dot to the debug page of senzari that shows if the URLs in a list were
called successfully and made a counter that shows how many were. I did that using Javascript and a little HTML.

Then I made a debug page for Lead Tracker using most of the code of the other debug page. After adding two more
Lead Creates, Gets and Deletes so that it is shown if the Created Leads have the corresponding to the scheduled date
correct status, I made the code cleaner.
For that I made the two biggest loops, which iterate over two arrays into oneloop and one array.
The problem was that some of the items in the second array only worked if they had the Id, that was
generated by the items in the first array. I had to turn the forEach loop I used before into a for loop
because a forEach loop loads the array and isn't affected by any changes made to the array after that.
For the for loop to work properly, I had to write a function that executes the AJAX request.
Here is the code for that:
for (i=0; i < data.length; i++) {
      (function(index) {
      var p = data[index]
      ...
        $.ajax({
  	  ...
I added the ms in which the URLs responded afterwards. Then I made the requests to be shown formatted for Fiddler at
the bottom of the page.
I also made the debug page look a little nicer with CSS.
I uploaded the page to github pages: http://spikele.github.io/
